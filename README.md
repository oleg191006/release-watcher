# GitHub Release Notificator

A Node.js + Express service that lets users subscribe to GitHub repository releases and receive email notifications.

## Features

- Subscribe with `email + owner/repo`
- Email confirmation by opening a confirmation link
- Unsubscribe by token (confirmed subscriptions only)
- Periodic release scanner (cron)
- PostgreSQL persistence
- Redis cache for GitHub API responses (TTL 10 minutes)
- Email delivery via Resend API (recommended) with SMTP fallback support
- Unit and integration tests with Jest

## Hosted App (Render)

Production deployment:

- https://notificator-rxb1.onrender.com/

Notes:

- The app is hosted on Render.
- API key protection can be enabled/disabled via `API_KEY` environment variable.
- If `API_KEY` is set, API requests must include `X-API-Key`.

## Current Demo Limitations

- Email sending is currently in test mode because no custom verified sending domain is configured.
- In this mode, subscribe/unsubscribe email flow is effectively limited to the verified test inbox: `olegchaplia2006@gmail.com`.
- To support subscriptions for any user email, a verified domain must be added in Resend and used in `RESEND_FROM`.
- The Render free tier can put the service to sleep when idle.
- Because of this, the first request after inactivity may take extra time while the service wakes up.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Axios
- Nodemailer
- Resend API
- Jest + Supertest

## Prerequisites

Install the following before starting:

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+
- Docker Desktop (optional, but recommended for local PostgreSQL)

## 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oleg191006/release-watcher.git
cd release-watcher
npm install
```

## 2. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# App
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional API key auth (leave empty to disable)
API_KEY=

# Database (local Postgres)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=notificator
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres

# GitHub API token (optional, but recommended to reduce rate-limit issues)
GITHUB_TOKEN=

# Redis cache (optional but recommended)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
GITHUB_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=600

# Email (recommended: Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=
RESEND_FROM=Notificator <onboarding@resend.dev>
RESEND_TIMEOUT_MS=10000

# SMTP fallback (optional)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true
SMTP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
SMTP_GREETING_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
SMTP_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
EMAIL_FROM=GitHub Notificator <noreply@notificator.app>

# Scanner schedule (every 10 minutes)
SCAN_CRON=*/10 * * * *
```

Notes:

- If `API_KEY` is empty, API key middleware is disabled.
- For local/dev and cloud deployment, `RESEND_API_KEY` is the recommended email path.
- `RESEND_FROM` must be a sender accepted by your Resend account.

## 3. Start PostgreSQL

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up -d db redis
```

This starts PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432` with:

- database: `notificator`
- user: `postgres`
- password: `postgres`

### Option B: Existing local Postgres

Use your own DB and update `.env` (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`) accordingly.

## 4. Run the App

Development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production-like mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Server should be available at:

- `http://localhost:3000`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`

## 5. Database Migrations

No manual migration command is required.

Migrations run automatically on startup in `src/server.js`.

## 6. Test the API Quickly

### Browser UI

Open:

- `http://localhost:3000`

### Postman

Import collection:

- `postman/GitHub_Release_Notificator.postman_collection.json`

Recommended variable setup:

- `baseUrl = http://localhost:3000`
- `apiKey =` (empty unless API key is enabled)
- `email = your test email`
- `repo = nodejs/node` (or another public repo)

### Subscription Flow (Current Behavior)

1. User subscribes with email + repo.
2. Service sends an email with a confirmation link.
3. The same confirmation email also contains an unsubscribe token.
4. Subscription remains `Pending` until the user opens the confirmation link.
5. User confirms by opening the link in a browser.
6. Confirmation page is shown in browser (instead of raw JSON).
7. Only confirmed subscriptions can be unsubscribed.
8. Unsubscribe is done by providing the token in the app form or API call.

## 7. Run Tests

Unit/integration test run:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Coverage run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Project Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start server with nodemon
- `npm start` — start server in normal mode
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run test:unit` — run tests once
- `npm test` — run tests with coverage
